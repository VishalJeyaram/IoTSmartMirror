# Getting Started with the smart mirror

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are three main components of the app that need to be run

1. In the project directory (react-flask-app), you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

2. Type 'cd api'. Then type 'venv\Scripts\activate' to run the app in your python env. Then run:

### `flask run`

3. Type 'cd server'. Then run:

### `npm run devStart`

Enjoy our smart mirror!
