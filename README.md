# Getting Started with the smart mirror

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was developed for the module LH The Internet of Things (30065) at The University of Birmingham during my exchange semester abroad. This is an interface for a smart IoT mirror that allows users to check the date and time, weather conditions, play Spotify music, add items to their Todo lists, and use maps.

Once you have cloned the repo, you need to do the following steps. There are three main components of the app that need to be run.

1. In the project directory (react-flask-app), you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

2. Type 'cd api'. Then type 'venv\Scripts\activate' to run the app in your python env. Then run:

### `flask run`

3. Type 'cd server'. Then run:

### `npm run devStart`

Enjoy our smart mirror!
